## Naming conventions
We agreed that our naming conventions would follow our "Pokemon system", the code name of each project msut use either a GYM
, Badge or a gym owners pokemon. To make life a little easier I found this link on Bulbapedia:

## Assets
### Kenny UI
Considering Kenny assets are online, free and open source we thought it would be a nice addition to the project. It also brings
the whole project together by making the assets uniform, adding a degree of professionalism.
